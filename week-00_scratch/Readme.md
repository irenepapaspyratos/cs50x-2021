# Hopper Catch

Catch me if you can..!

## About

My game consists of a cat catching grasshoppers and each level is won as soon as all grasshoppers are gone.   

The requirements:
- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture.

## How To Start

- Download HopperCatch_ScratchProject.sb3
- Go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted
- Upload HopperCatch_ScratchProject.sb3 using the file tab
- Maximize the game's preview window
- Start the game by clicking on the green flag

## How To Play

After choosing the desired level with a mouse-click, you have to point with the curser (using the mouse) to a spot and then either perform a mouse-click or press the space key (last option is easier at higher levels!) to move the cat. Point on a grasshopper to catch it - if properly catched, the cat will munch it.

### Hint

Don't wait for the cat to finish eating before catching the next grasshopper... ;)
