# Harvard's CS50x 2021

I solved all labs and problems during 8 weeks in autumn 2021, but did not build the final project until 2023 due to other courses. Therefore I had to resubmit my old solutions and decided to keep them also in my personal account.

**!! DO NOT COPY THIS SOLUTIONS !!**

</br>

You will learn NOTHING if you copy solutions without experiencing the journey yourself...
