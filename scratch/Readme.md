# Hopper Catch

Catch me if you can..!

## About

I created this game in August 2021 for CS50x.
It consists of a cat catching grasshoppers and each level is won as soon as all grasshoppers are gone.

## How To Start

- Download HopperCatch_ScratchProject.sb3
- Go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted
- Upload HopperCatch_ScratchProject.sb3 using the file tab
- Maximize the game's preview window
- Start the game by clicking on the green flag

## How To Play

After choosing the desired level with a mouse-click, you have to point with the curser (using the mouse) to a spot and then either perform a mouse-click or press the space key (last option is easier at higher levels!) to move the cat. Point on a grasshopper to catch it - if properly catched, the cat will munch it.

### Hint

Don't wait for the cat to finish eating before catching the next grasshopper... ;)
